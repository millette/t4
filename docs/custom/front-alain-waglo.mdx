# Social-Economy Groupware/Workflow Platform

Authored and promoted by [Alain Farmer](/custom/about-alain-waglo)

## Executive summary

Many social economy enterprises (EES) are struggling to cope with their IT.

Me and some colleagues are currently developing a [new open-source groupware platform](https://github.com/millette/tournemain/).

Our initial aim is to develop this; with social enterprises in mind and involved in the process.

I wish to meet with these social enterprises, to assess their IT needs, practices and wishes.

In particular, I wish to meet and dialogue with member/s of the following :

- Chantier de l'économie sociale
- Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutualité
- Any person/s or organisation/s that you may recommend.

I am in pre-startup phase of a social economy enterprise (EES).

This EES will be sustained by providing fee-based technical support and custom development.

Support services such as :

- installation assistance
- migration to this platform
- training and documentation
- technical support for using it
- technical support for customizing it
- customizations and further automation
- new features and improvements on-demand
- continuous quality control and improvements
- hosting and animation of a community of practice (CoP)

The provisioning of these support services will create many IT jobs.

This platform will also help governance bodies to oversee and help these enterprises (metrics).

## Additional remarks

This platform will be adapted to/for the Sustainable Development Association (SDA).

This platform will be adapted to/for participatory for-profit enterprises (Jay Wisenthal).

This platform will be a hosted online service.

Installable apps will run on computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) and phones (iOS, Android).

**Community of practice (CoP)** is a group of people who share a craft or a profession. The concept was first proposed by cognitive anthropologist Jean Lave and educational theorist Etienne Wenger in their 1991 book Situated Learning (Lave & Wenger 1991). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book Communities of Practice (Wenger 1998). A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally (Lave & Wenger 1991). CoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunch room at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a "virtual community of practice" (VCoP) (Dubé, Bourhis & Jacob 2005) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards and newsgroups, or a "mobile community of practice" (MCoP) (Kietzmann et al. 2013) when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.

**Groupware** is an ensemble of computer-mediated technologies, know-how, and methods that allows networked workgroups to communicate, collaborate, and cooperate by sharing information and other digital resources. Pierre Lévy defines groupware as a decision support model for distributed groups that uses the hypertextual and iconographic potential of contemporary computer-mediated networking solutions. Groupware can also be defined by enumerating the functionalities that we expect from the technologies that support it. Given the numerous and diverse nature of the functionalities, as well as the underlying technologies of groupware, the functionalities can be classified into five categories: 1) interpersonal communication, 2) coordination, 3) collaboration, 4) access to the information and collective memory of the group, and 5) automation of the administrative processes.

**Workflow** consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms. From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work. The flow being described may refer to a document, service, or product that is being transferred from one step to another. Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as information technology, teams, projects and hierarchies.
